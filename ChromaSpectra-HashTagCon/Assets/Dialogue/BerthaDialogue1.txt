Hello?!*Can you hear me?^Hello Dearie. I see you found the key under the gnome.*Who might you be?^My name is Claire Voyant. I come from a long line of mediums, and felt you reach out to me for help!*I kept hearing this music and I followed it here. What is your name?^Oh how wonderful, someone really was listening.*My name is Bertha Marigold.^It is nice to meet you Bertha. In your message, you said you are trapped. Do you know why?^No I don’t…*I wish I did. Apparently becoming a ghost does not fix your memory.^That’s alright. I am here to help!*Usually ghosts are tethered by unfinished business.*Is there anything you had been wanting to do before you passed?^Hmmmm.*..*...*Come to think of it, yes there was.*I had been wanting to make my famous apple pie for the children that live in the neighborhood.^Oh that sounds lovely! That sounds like unfinished business to me.*Do you still have the ingredients to make the pie?^Yes I do. Follow me whenever you are ready, dearie, to the kitchen.*I don’t remember where the ingredients are, so you will have to find them yourself.
