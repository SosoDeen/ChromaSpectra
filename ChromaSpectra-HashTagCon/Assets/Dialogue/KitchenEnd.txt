The pie already smells delicious. No wonder why this is famous.^Yes, this was my husband's favorite dessert. How I miss him so… I miss them all, you know.*...*My children moved out many many years ago and my husband passed away last year. My children and grandchildren still visited for the holidays, but most days were very lonely without them all…^What would you do to pass the time?^Other than baking, I’d read books with Pickles my cat.*Actually, the day I passed I was looking through the family scrapbook. Pickles and I were sitting in my husband’s favorite armchair.*You know, it would be really nice to see them again. In the scrapbook, I mean.*I just don’t know where my darned glasses are. It seems silly but apparently becoming a ghost doesn’t fix your eye sight.^Alright, I can look for them! Do you have any idea of the area they might be in?^I most likely dropped them somewhere between the armchair in the living room to the bedroom.^Okay, I’ll start looking while we wait for the pie to finish baking. Maybe this will help you further untether yourself from this realm.
